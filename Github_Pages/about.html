        <p>Subject Short Bio
The person that you see in the photograph above is my wife, Katelin Masoner. Katelin is 30 years old and is the mother of two amazing children who are age 7 and age 3 currently.
Katelin currently works as a manager over the fast-food chain Big Biscuit overseeing the day-to-day operations while ensuring that all standards are met through multiple stores. 
Katelin has four siblings Nathaniel Gann, Daniel Gann, Jacob Gann, and Kaela Burchett. On the chance that Katelin gets a day off she enjoys spending time with the kids, playing with the dogs, playing video games on the Xbox, or watching a new movie on TV. 
Katelin is the subject of this interview because she is the wind beneath my wings, and she is the entire reason I decided to come back and finish my education. 
My wife has motivated me to reach new heights in my career since we have gotten together, all while maintaining whatever she can to take something off of my plate. 
Some people never have the chance to meet their soulmate in their lifetime, and I got lucky enough to find mine early enough to spend the rest of my life with her. 
This bio site will highlight some of her hobbies, and a special interview that I conducted with her about what makes her feel like her. 
Katelin has not always had a good life, and like most people she faced many hardships, but she found was to persevere and continue on knowing the best was still yet to come.
